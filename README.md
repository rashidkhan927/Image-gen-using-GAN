Image Generation using GAN
This repository contains a project focused on image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
GANs are a powerful type of neural network architecture used for generating new data samples that are similar to the input data.
This project demonstrates how GANs can be used to create realistic images through the adversarial process between two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator.

Overview
This project implements a GAN model to generate images from random noise. The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of the key steps involved:

Data Preprocessing: Data loading and normalization to prepare the dataset for training.

Generator Model: The architecture of the generator network that generates fake images.

Discriminator Model: The architecture of the discriminator network that classifies images as real or fake.
Training Loop: The adversarial training process between the generator and discriminator to improve image quality.

Results Visualization: Graphical representation of the generated images and how they improve during training.

Results
The GAN model generates realistic images after training for several epochs.
